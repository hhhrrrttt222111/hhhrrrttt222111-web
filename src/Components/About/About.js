                            I am Hemanth R, a second year student at Govt.Model Engineering college, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering and currently staying in Kochi. It has been my childhood dream to work in the field of computers and contribute to the world of technology. And I fulfill it by spending most of my living breathing hours in front of my laptop.

                        <p>                    
                            I have aspired to master in this field and become one of the best software engineers in the world for as long as I can remember. Having gone to great lengths to develop the necessary skills, I am well versed in different computer languages like C, C++, Python, Java etcâ€¦
                        </p>
                        <div className="line"></div>

                        <p>                    
                            With this knowledge I have been able to 
                            create various successful projects as well as help others with similar goals achieve  them. I spend much of my free time brushing up on my computer skills by trying new and different things. Apart from this, I am an avid fan of football and cricket and if I am not tinkering about with some code, then you can probably find me playing these games.
